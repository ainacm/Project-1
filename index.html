    <h3>History of<em> The Spot</em></h3>
    <p>The co-founders of The Spot originally came up with the idea of this cafe in 2021 while having lunch at Chipotle in New York City. It was there that they decided to save up money and start their own journey of sharing two things they love the most, coffee and smoothies. Along with their idea they both enjoyed eating all kinds of food which is now a part of their cafe. The co-founders wanted to expand <em>The Spot </em>all over the Philippines so that every Filipino can also taste multi-cultural and non traditional foods without being too far from their own home. </p>
